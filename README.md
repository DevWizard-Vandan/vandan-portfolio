## 🚀 The Infinite Aperture
This portfolio is not just a showcase; it's a **cinematic journey** through the realms of distributed systems. Built with a focus on immersive storytelling, it uses **frame-by-frame video orchestration** and **physics-based interactions** to guide you through my engineering philosophy.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Cosmic Journey Hook**: A scroll-driven narrative that feels like exploring the divine architecture of code.
- **Dynamic Project Deities**: Three core pillars of engineering represented by Brahma (Creation), Shiva (Transformation), and Vishnu (Preservation).
- **Interactive Physics**: Real-time particle systems and hover-driven video interactions using Lucide-react and CSS physics.
- **Ultra-Performance**: Optimized asset loading with a custom preloader and multi-format fallback (WebP/JPG).

## 🛠 Project Pillars

### ⚡ Titan (The Harbinger of Speed)
*Ultra low-latency HFT matching engine.*
- **Performance**: 12.8M matches/sec with sub-microsecond latency.
- **Tech**: `Rust`, `Lock-Free DS`, `SPSC Ring`, `SIMD`, `io_uring`.
- **Core**: Designed for orchestrating market chaos with zero-copy networking.

### 🔱 MiniDrive (The Architect of Storage)
*Hybrid Cloud Storage solution.*
- **Feature**: Achieved **40% storage reduction** via block-level deduplication.
- **Tech**: `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `MinIO`, `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`, `Docker`.
- **Core**: Seamlessly blending MinIO object storage with sophisticated metadata management.

### 💎 Vajra (The Eternal Guardian)
*Distributed Vector Database.*
- **Architecture**: Custom Raft consensus implementation.
- **Tech**: `Rust`, `Raft`, `HNSW Indexing`, `gRPC`, `RocksDB`.
- **Core**: Optimized for AI/ML embedding storage with strong consistency and horizontal scaling.
